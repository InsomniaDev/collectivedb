## Need-To-Do

### In-memory Database
- [x] Create structs
- [ ] Hash to number and then round the decimal place of hash
- [ ] For the first time creation without the total depth being reached, need to create
- [ ] Hash key needs to be randomly generated



- [ ] Documentation for database usage is hosted on docker images and webserver is enabled with a docker parameter
    - [ ] Need to decide what documentation service to use. Github hosted docs?
- [ ] In-memory database needs to be able to know from the key provided if it contains that value
- [ ] Search for the memory in database
